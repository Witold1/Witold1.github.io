# LittleLink Version History

## Current Version: v3.11.0

### v3.11.0 - 07/28/2026
- Google icon refresh (2025/2026 redesigns): new buttons for Google, Google Calendar, Google Chat, Google Docs, Google Forms, Gmail, Google Meet, Google Photos, Google Sheets, and Google Slides; updated the Google Drive icon. Added a dedicated `.button-yt-music` class for YouTube Music.
- Accessibility & markup: removed `role="button"` from link buttons, converted the button stack to `<nav aria-label="Links">`, wrapped page content in `<main>`, fixed the canonical tag (was an invalid `<meta>`), removed the obsolete keywords meta, made the favicon path relative, and added `theme-color` metas plus a fill-in Open Graph/Twitter block.
- Performance: preload hints for the three above-the-fold font weights, explicit dimensions and `fetchpriority` on the avatar, and placeholder avatars re-exported at true 128px/256px.
- CSS cleanup: removed the duplicated legacy typography block in `style.css`, implemented the documented `theme-light` class, and simplified `@font-face` to woff2-only (deleting ~1.2 MB of legacy .eot/.svg/.ttf/.woff files).
- Icons: fixed missing `viewBox` on both Bluesky icons (they rendered clipped) and optimized several oversized icons; removed stale unused icons and `google-podcasts.svg` (service discontinued).
- Deployment: moved `.dockerignore` to the repo root so Docker actually applies it, and added `.assetsignore` so Cloudflare deploys stop serving repo metadata like `.git/`.
- CI: the contrast check now catches edits to existing buttons and handles hyphenated class names.
- Removed Kit (Kit.co shut down in May 2026).

### v3.7.0 - 4/18/2025
- Added [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/).

### v3.6.0 - 3/25/2025
- Finally adds Docker support to LittleLink. See [PR #151](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink/pull/151), thank you [@lllahaye](https://github.com/lllahaye).
  - Docker support has been a long-standing community request. While I previously closed similar PRs in an effort to keep the LittleLink repo as minimal as possible, several community forks emerged that added Docker support independently. Over the last few weeks I had been reconsidering this stance—this PR arrived at just the right time.
